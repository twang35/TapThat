TapThat
=======

Our generation has always prided ourselves on being able to multitask, but what we really need is to be able to focus our attention and live in the moment. 

TapThat allows each user to connect with a friend and communicate via a live sketch session. 

The app is compiled on PhoneGap and the database runs Node.js with Socket.IO sending and receiving real-time data.
